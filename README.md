# pf-popgen-web-pipeline
Project Overview
This repository contains a Java-based web pipeline for Plasmodium falciparum population genetics research. It automates the process from raw FASTQ sequencing data to advanced analyses, making it easy for researchers to explore genetic relationships.
Main Features
Automation: Converts FASTQ files to gVCF files and generates PCA and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees automatically.

Database Integration: Works with large public databases like Pf3k or Pf7, offering flexibility for comprehensive analysis.

Web Interface: Accessible through a web page, ideal for users without deep bioinformatics expertise.

Tools Used: Utilizes standard tools like Trimmomatic, Picard, GATK, and VCFtools for reliable processing.

Intended Use
Perfect for researchers studying malaria parasite evolution, drug resistance, and population structure, providing insights through sample clustering and evolutionary tracing.
